Modeling language lies at the core of many natural language processing tasks, such as speech recognition and synthesis, document classification, grammar and spelling checking, parsing, machine translation, and information retrieval. In general, the task of statistical language models is to estimate the likelihood of a sequence of words. This information can then be used to reject invalid sentences or resolve ambiguities. In case of automatic speech recognition the language model guides and constrains the search among alternative word hypotheses \cite{glass2013automatic}.
